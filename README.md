# Breadth first search

## Description

This assignment is about putting your graph knowledge to practice by implementing a simple friends-of-friends finder algorithm.

You have the following data structures:

User
id: The unique ID of the user
firstName
lastName
friends: A list or array of IDs that this user is friends with

Database is already implemented. Your task is to write three functions:
* One that lists the minimum distance between two users returning an integer (friends' distance should be 1 from each other).
* One that lists a given user's friends-of-friends at a given distance. The list should not contain duplicates.
* One that returns a shortest path between two users.
